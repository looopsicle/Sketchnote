## 🚀 Project Overview

Sketchnote is a simple yet functional note-taking app prototype built with Flutter.  
The application showcases various Flutter features across multiple assignments, emphasizing clean UI, state management, and cross-platform capabilities.

## 🧩 Task Breakdown

### 🧠 Task 1 – User Interface
- Designed an appealing and intuitive UI.  
- Implemented basic Flutter widgets:
  - `Text`, `Container`, `Row`, `Column`, `Stack`, `Image`
  - Layout elements using `Padding`, `Margin`, and `Alignment`
  - List layouts with `ListView` and `GridView`
  - Basic UI theming with `ThemeData`

---

### ⚙️ Task 2 – State Management (Riverpod)
- Implemented **Riverpod** for state management across at least three widgets.  
- Demonstrated efficient state sharing and updating in multiple parts of the app.

---

### 💬 Task 3 – Interaction Features
Implemented the following Flutter features:
- **Alert & Dialog** → `showDialog()` confirmation for actions like delete or cancel  
- **Local State** → Managed state using `StatefulWidget` and local variables  
- **Option Selection** → Confirmation dialogs and interactive choice menus  
- **Image Widget** → Displayed and handled user-added images  
- **Loading Indicator** → Used overlays or spinners for async operations

### 📱 Task 4 – Core Flutter Concepts
Covered the foundational aspects of Flutter development:
- Cross-platform vs Native concepts  
- Flutter SDK & IDE setup (Android Studio / VS Code)  
- Project structure and file organization  
- Variables, data types, control flow, functions, classes, and OOP  
- Null safety principles  
- Stateless vs Stateful widgets  
- Form handling & validation  
- `setState()` and lifting state up  
- Navigation using `Navigator.push`, `pop`, and named routes  
- Data communication between pages  
- HTTP requests (GET/POST) and JSON parsing  
- Displaying data from REST APIs  

---

### 🧱 Task 5 – Persistent Storage
- **Riverpod debugging flow** across multiple files.  
- Data persistence using:
  - **SQLite** for structured local storage  
  - **SharedPreferences** for simple key–value storage

---

### 🧪 Task 6 – Unit Testing
- Implemented **unit tests** to verify app logic and ensure stable functionality.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Cross-platform development with Flutter  
- Clean and modular project structure (`lib/app`, `lib/features`, `lib/config`, etc.)  
- State management using Riverpod  
- User interaction and dialog handling  
- Local persistence using SQLite and SharedPreferences  
- Fundamental Flutter UI components and layouts  
- Testing and debugging best practices
